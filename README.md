# online-store

## Project Description ##

This is a basic online store website with some JS functionality, but no submission to server yet.
Some basic static pages, as well as a catalogue of frames for sale render dynamically, using JS.
These items can be added to a shopping cart in various iterations (sizes, colours). Delivery details can be specified and totals calculated with VAT, discount coupons and shipping fees. An order number is generated.
